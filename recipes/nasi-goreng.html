    <p class="title-list">Ingredients</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <p class="list">For the Spice Paste</p>
        <li class="list-child">2 small shallots (2 ounces; 55g), roughly chopped</li>
        <li class="list-child">3 medium cloves garlic</li>
        <li class="list-child">1 large fresh green chile, such as Fresno or Holland, stemmed and seeded, or 1 teaspoon <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/sambal-oelek-southeast-asian-indonesian-chili-paste" target="blank">sambal oelek,</a> such as Huy Fong (see note)</li>
        <li class="list-child">1/2 teaspoon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ABC-Indonesia-seasoning-single-use-parallel/dp/B00AKA94IY/" target="blank">terasi</a> (Indonesian shrimp paste), optional (see note)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="list">
        <p class="list">For the Nasi Goreng</p>
        <li class="list-child">4 cups cold cooked jasmine rice (21 ounces; 600g) or other medium- to long-grain rice (see note)</li>
        <li class="list-child">2 tablespoons (30ml) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bango-Sweet-Sauce-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B00I7Q0AXG/" target="blank">kecap manis</a> (see note), plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li class="list-child">2 teaspoons (10ml) soy sauce </li>
        <li class="list-child">Kosher salt</li>
        <li class="list-child">Ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title-list">Steps</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li class="list-child"><strong>For the Spice Paste:</strong> Add half the shallots to a mortar and grind with pestle until a coarse pur√©e forms. Add remaining shallots, followed by garlic, chile, and terasi (if using), grinding with pestle until each ingredient is mostly incorporated before adding the next. The final paste should resemble thick oatmeal in texture. Alternatively, combine all spice paste ingredients in a small food processor and process until they form a paste. </li>
        <li class="list-child"><strong>For the Nasi Goreng:</strong> If using day-old rice, transfer rice to a bowl and break rice up with your hands into individual grains.</li>
        <li class="list-child">Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add spice paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of wok or pan to prevent paste from burning, until a pungent smell permeates your kitchen and paste turns a few shades darker, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium at any time if paste appears to be browning too quickly. </li>
        <li class="list-child">Add rice to wok and stir to coat with spice paste. Add kecap manis and soy sauce. Stir and cook until rice is evenly colored and hot throughout. Season with salt and white pepper. </li>
        <li class="list-child">Divide rice between two plates and top each plate of rice with a fried egg. Garnish with cucumber and tomato slices and shower with fried shallots, if you like. Serve immediately with kecap manis alongside for drizzling. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="para">Notes</h2>
    <p class="para">Terasi is an Indonesian shrimp paste that can be found in well-stocked Asian markets or online. We recommend purchasing handy single-serving packets. If you can't find terasi, you may substitute belacan (Malaysian or Singaporean shrimp paste) or Thai shrimp paste, or simply omit it altogether.</p>
    <p class="para"><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/sambal-oelek-southeast-asian-indonesian-chili-paste" target="blank">Sambal oelek</a> is an Indonesian chile paste, traditionally made with nothing more than hot red chiles and salt. You can find it at Asian markets or in the "international" aisle of some supermarkets.</p>
    <p class="para">Kecap manis is Indonesian sweet soy sauce, typically made by combining soy sauce with palm sugar. We recommend Cap Bango kecap manis, but you may also find ABC and Conimex brands available online or in Asian markets. For more information, read our <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/guide-to-kecap-manis" target="blank">kecap manis explainer.</a></p>
    <p class="para">For best results, use rice that has been refrigerated for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. If using freshly cooked rice, spread rice on a tray and allow to cool for 5 minutes before using.</p>
